**Summary**
Hi. My name is Maksim Kopravchuk. I'm from Omsk, Russian Federation. I'm 33 years old engineer, got Specialist degree in Omsk State Transport University.  
I chose this profession because I like engineering and I like to solve non-standard problems. But today it's time to move on, and I want to change  
my profession. To take all the best from my previous experience and enrich it with new. My favorite activities are gym, cycling and a wide variety  
of music, so I don't get bored. On the contrary, finding time for everything you want is getting harder every day :-)
